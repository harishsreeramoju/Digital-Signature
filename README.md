 A digital signature is a cryptographic technique that addresses these challenges by 
providing a secure means of verifying the identity of the sender and the integrity of the message. 
It functions similarly to a handwritten signature but with much higher levels of security, 
leveraging public key cryptography. By using a pair of keys—a private key for signing and a 
public key for verification—digital signatures ensure that the information originates from a 
trusted source and has not been tampered with during transmission.
